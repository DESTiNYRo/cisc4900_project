8/27/25,2.5,"Research, Training, Learning","Reviewed the course handouts and added due dates listed to my calendar app. Contacted CTP instrcutor to be my supervisor for the course. Currently doing research on data science, trying to find a usecase for our project.","Data Science project can be vague or common if theres no clear intention/purpose. I think I will try to focus on education. If CTP project doesn't work, I will turn to my plan B: website/software for special needs children. ",
